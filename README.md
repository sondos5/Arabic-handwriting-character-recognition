# Arabic-handwriting-character-recognition
Handwriting recognition is the ability of a computer or device to take as input handwriting from sources such as printed physical documents, pictures and other devices, or to use handwriting as a direct input to a touchscreen and then interpret this as text


Dataset
The dataset for this project originates from kaggle kernels which include Arabic Digits and Arabic Letters.

All the datasets are CSV files representing the image pixels values and their corresponding label.

Here are some more details about the datasets:


Arabic Letters Dataset is composed of 16,800 characters written by 60 participants, and 90% of participants are right-hand. Each participant wrote each character (from ’alef’ to ’yeh’) ten times. The images were scanned at the resolution of 300 dpi. The dataset is partitioned into two sets: a training set of 13,440 characters to 480 images per class and a test set of 3,360 characters to 120 images per class. Writers of training set and test set are exclusive. Ordering of including writers to test set are randomized to make sure that writers of test set are not from a single institution to ensure variability of the test set.
